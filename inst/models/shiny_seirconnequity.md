## SEIR Equity Model

The "Equity" version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model is comparable to the compartmental version of the same name. At each step, agents randomly interact with each other, regardless of the distance between them. However, susceptibility is not homogenous as it will be determined by agents gender, age, and ethnicity.

### Parameters

The SEIR model has the following parameters:

- **Disease Name**: The name of the disease being modeled.
- **% of Population Infected**: The percentage of the population that is infected at the start of the simulation.
- **Probability of exposure (daily)**: The probability that an individual will be exposed to the virus on a given day.
- **Recovery probability (daily)**: The probability that an individual will recover from the virus on a given day.
- **Incubation Days**: The number of days that an individual is in the exposed state before becoming infectious.
- **Simulation Time (Days)**: The number of days to simulate.
- **Seed**: The seed for the random number generator.
- **Population Structure**: The population structure to use for the simulation.
- **NPIs**: The non-pharmaceutical interventions to use for the simulation.
